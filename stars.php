        <h2>Stars</h2>
        <p>
            Stars are massive glowing spheres of hot gas, primarily hydrogen and helium.
            They produce energy through nuclear fusion in their cores.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our Sun is a medium-sized star that provides heat and light necessary for life
            on Earth. Stars vary in size, color, and lifespan.

        <h2>Nebulae</h2>
        <p>
            Nebulae are enormous clouds of gas and dust in space. They are often referred
            to as the nurseries of stars because new stars are born inside them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some nebulae are formed when stars explode as supernovae, spreading elements
            across space and contributing to the creation of new star systems.
